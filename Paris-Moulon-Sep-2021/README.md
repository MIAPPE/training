# Plant Phenotyping data managment training

Contributors to this training material : Cyril Pommier, Daniel Faria, Célia Michotey, Elizabeth Arnaud, Anne Françoise Adam Blondon

## Learning Objectives:

To get acquainted with plant phenotyping data managment constraints and particularities

To be able to select and use relevant data standards

## Learning Outcomes:

Learners know how to complementary use standards and ontologies
Learners can describe their measurment protocole and practices using MIAPPE and Crop ontology.
Learners can fill a template with their data.
Learners can apply the standards concept in some data managment tools.

## MIAPPE: description phenotyping experiments
Fill the [MIAPPE Template](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/raw/master/MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1/MIAPPE_templates/MIAPPEv1.1_training_spreadsheet.xlsx) with information from one of the following datasets:
* Your own favorite dataset (preferable)
* [Poplar example](https://doi.org/10.15454/YJFFFJ)
* [Cedar example](https://doi.org/10.15454/KJDWJM)
* [MAIZE Drops example](https://doi.org/10.15454/IASSTN)
* [Biodata.pt slides and exercises](https://github.com/BioData-PT/MIAPPE_Training)

## Crop ontology
Optional complementary hands on: 
Fill the [Crop ontology[(www.cropontology.org/) [template](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/110906/TD_template_v5.1.xls?sequence=5&isAllowed=y) with your own phenotyping variables if you have a dataset with extensive informations.
