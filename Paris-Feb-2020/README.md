# Plant Phenotyping data managment training

## Learning Objectives:

To get acquainted with plant phenotyping data managment constraints and particularities
To be able to select and utilise relevant data standards

## Learning Outcomes:

Learners know how to complementary use standards and ontologies
Learners can describe their measurment protocole and practices using MIAPPE and Crop ontology.
Learners can fill a template with their data.
Learners can apply the standards concept in some data managment tools.
